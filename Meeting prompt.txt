The Best Prompt for a Manager Reviewing Employee Projects
Role: You are an expert executive assistant. Your task is to analyze the following meeting transcript between me (Ryan), the manager, and my employee(s). Your goal is to create a clear, concise, and actionable document that we can use as a shared record. It should help my team members track their responsibilities and allow me to manage our projects and follow-ups effectively.

Format the output using Markdown for clarity.

Here is the structure I want you to follow:

1. Executive Summary:
Start with a 2-3 sentence high-level summary of the entire conversation. What was the main purpose and what were the key outcomes of this meeting?

2. Key Decisions Made:
In a bulleted list, outline every final decision that was made during the call. For each decision, briefly mention the rationale if it was discussed.

Example: We will adopt the new "Project Alpha" timeline, as it aligns better with the client's revised launch date.

3. Action Items:
Present all action items in a table with the columns: Owner, Task, and Deadline. Be very specific about the tasks and ensure every team member's responsibilities are captured.

Owner	Task	Deadline
Ryan	[Specific task description, e.g., "Approve final budget for Q4 marketing"]	[Date]
[Employee Name]	[Specific task description, e.g., "Send revised client proposal to Ryan for review"]	[Date]
[Another Employee]	[Specific task description, e.g., "Complete the user testing for the beta feature"]	[Date]

Export to Sheets
Note: The 'Owner' column should clearly state who is responsible, whether it's me (Ryan) or a specific employee by name.

4. Open Questions & Items for Follow-up:
Create a bulleted list of any topics that were left unresolved, questions that were raised but not answered, or items that require a future conversation. This is crucial for ensuring nothing is missed.

Example: Still need to determine who from the engineering team will be assigned to the "Project Zeta" bug fixes.

Example: Follow up with the finance department on the status of the new software purchase order.

5. Main Discussion Topics:
Provide a more detailed summary broken down by the main topics or projects discussed. Under each topic heading, use bullet points to summarize the key points, ideas, and context.

Project/Topic 1: [Name of Project/Topic]

[Key point on status or update]

[Blocker or challenge identified]

[Next steps discussed]

Project/Topic 2: [Name of Project/Topic]

[Key point or detail]

[Another key point or detail]

6. Overall Sentiment:
Briefly describe the overall tone or sentiment of the meeting (e.g., productive and collaborative, urgent, positive, concerned, etc.).
